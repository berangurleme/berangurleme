I am Beran.

I lived in Kocaeli.

I now live Istanbul.

I read sci-fi books and maintain a medium sized collection.

I watch a lot movies and I used to run a weekly movie night.

I am also watch lots of animes and have a list since 2007.

I obsess on building my solo indie video game when I'm not working.

I have a beautiful wife and two apple snails.

I write code and (used to) write satiric comments about the things I see.

I was the research assistant at kocaeli university.

I am not anymore, but they're still suck at researching.

I am now working at Minerva Yazilim as System Development Specialist.

I have a more detailed résumé if you're into that sort of thing.

I used to be what average turkish aspired to be: hopless-tax-payer.

I am now just a hyper-creative person from any reasonable perspective.
