I write code and (used to) write [satiric comments](https://twitter.com/turumaji) about the things I see.

I was the research assistant👨‍🏫 at [kocaeli university](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/kocaeli-university).

I have a more detailed résumé if you're into that sort of thing📝.

I used to be what average turkish aspired to be: [hopless-tax-payer](https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BCrkiye%27deki_vergiler)💸.

I am now just a 🎯hyper-creative🎨 person from any reasonable perspective.
